# A.I.-Bot

This is a simple implementation of a pretrained model deployed on a webpage using Flask (python), HTML, and Javascript. This is the basic part of a much bigger project I am working on. Feel free to download and try!

P.S.
Put index.html in a folder called templates in the same directory. A zip file is added as well in case there is any confusion about the templates folder.
